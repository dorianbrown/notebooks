    "We consider a situation where a list of English language documents are given and a class to which each of these belongs. We would like to extract a set of features from each document (in a consistent manner) and to choose a classification model to train on these data. As always, we need to split our data into train, validation and test partition or apply k-fold cross validation. In this training we will simplify by simply splitting this documents list at random into train and test parts (0.70 train and 0.30 test).\n",

    "## Naive Bayes Classifier with binary features\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most simple types of machine learning models that is suitable here is the so called Naïve Bayes model. The simplest form of this model is of the binary classification type. There we assume that each observation consists of a vector of binary valued features $X=(x_1,x_2,…,x_k)$ (each component $x_j$ is either 0 or 1 valued) and a binary target value $Y$. By the basic Bayes theorem we have that\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align*} p(Y \\mid x_1,x_2,...,x_k) &= \\frac{p(Y)\\ p(x_1,x_2,...,x_k \\mid Y)}{p(x_1,x_2,...,x_k)} \\\\\n",
    "&= \\frac{p(Y)\\ p(x_1,x_2,...,x_k \\mid Y)}{\\sum_{i=0}^1P(x_1,x_2,...,x_k\\mid Y = i)\\ p(Y=i)}\\end{align*}\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $X=(x_1,x_2,…,x_k)$ is a binary valued sequence of feature values for a given observation. In this case we 'only' need to estimate probabilities $P(Y=1)$, $P(Y=0)$, and $P(x_1,x_2,…,x_k|Y=0)$, $P(x_1,x_2,…,x_k|Y=1)$ for each possible binary sequence $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ of feature values. Now for a feature vector of length $k$, there are $2^k$ distinct binary sequences of length $k$ (in each position we can have 0 or 1, so we indeed have to take k-th power of 2). So total number of parameters to estimate is $2\\cdot2^k +2$ = 'waaay too many!'.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feeling of this number, if we have many features, say as many as there are different words in a list of documents, of we would work with 200 different words, then $2^{200}=16^{50}$ which is a number larger then number of atoms in the universe! Also, Some of these combinations of binary values are typically very rare in our data which amounts to very low significance (certainty) of our estimate, and that translates directly to low predictive performance of our model.\n",
